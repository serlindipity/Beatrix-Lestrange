                <h2>The Journey to Destiny</h2>
                <p>
                    This Story is inspired by the Sorting Hat Ceremony from the movie Harry Potter
                    & the Philosopher's stone. Beatrix Lestrange is going to attend Hogwarts School of
                    Witchcraft and Wizardry for the upcoming School Year. She's known as the daughter of
                    a merciless murderer, Bellatrix Lestrange. In Hogwarts, every first-year student
                    shall be sorted to their designated houses by the sorting hat's judgment, but what
                    happens if the sorting hat gives her a situation instead and lets Beatrix make her
                    own choices? Would she still be able to enter Slytherin, where she can make real
                    friends with the cunning folk that uses any means to achieve their ends? Or she might
                    now belong in Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart, they're daring, nerve and
                    chivalry set Gryffindors apart; She might also belong in Hufflepuff, Where witches &
                    wizards are just and loyal, those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;
                    Or perhaps in wise old Ravenclaw, if she has a ready mind, those of wit and learning
                    will always find their kind.
