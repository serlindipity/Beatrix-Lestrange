                    fter contemplating, I decided to turn around and help my teammate as fast as I could but to my surprise a group of medical wizards casted a spell that send my teammate
                    floating in the air and landed softly in a cushion-like bed. I ran towards him to check up on him and said
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Captain, Are you okay? Are you hurt? Is ther---”</b> He pushed me to cut me off, he stared at me with raging eyes and said
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“You dumb roach! I told you not to lose the snitch. I told you not to lose focus no matter what! Are you stupid?”</b> W-what? I was just trying to help him, and this is his response?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“I was trying to save you and prevent you from hurting yourself. What’s the point of winning if one of us is hurt?”</b> I replied, then He looked at me sternly and said
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“NOTHING MATTERS EXCEPT THIS GAME! IF WE LOST, ALL OUR SACRIFICES WOULD BE PUT TO WASTE. STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR YOUR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY.” </b> He picked up his broomstick and continued
                </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg" src="../../3 Images/snitch.gif" />
                <img class="pagecontentimg1" src="../../3 Images/captain.png" />
                <p>
                    <b>“You better pray that you get that snitch and win this game.” </b> I gulped at the sight of him. I am so dead. But why am I to blame? Is it wrong to have concern for your teammates?
                    The game is nothing if one of us would be seriously injured right? I picked up my broom and flew.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just when I am about to rush back to the game, our opponent got the snitch. The game resulted from 2-3 and they won. I flew back to the stage for the awarding ceremony. The looks that my
                    teammates are giving me send shivers to my bones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re walking back to the quarters when my captain pulled me aside. He deadly stared at me and said
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“You are a disgrace to this house, Lestrange. You don’t belong here. Get out. This house does not need losers like you, anyways.”</b> He turned around and walked away. I feel the guilt and embarrassment.
                    I was banished because of my ignorance. Where should I go now?
                </p>
