                    opened my eyes and saw all the people filled the whole stadium. I heard the roaring cheers and the battle cry of the students, screaming in the top of their lungs saying
                    GRYFFINDOR, SLYTHERIN, HUFFLEPUFF AND RAVENCLAW.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I was so immersed in the cheers of the students, someone tapped me from the back saying
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Hey, newbie get moving. It’s time already. Remember, you need to get that golden snitch. N-O M-A-T-T-E-R W-H-A-T.” </b> I looked up and saw this weird looking guy. It says captain in his shirt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“What? What? Why me? what should I do?”</b> I responded anxiously. He angrily stomps his foot on the ground and lift me by my shirt saying
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Are you stupid? All you have to do is to find that golden flying ball with wings called snitch in order for the team to WIN, okay?” </b>I nodded fiercely in order to avoid eye contact with him. He looked at me intently
                    before putting me down then proceeds to walk towards the field.
                </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg1" src="../../3 Images/quidditch team.jfif" />
                <p>
                    I gathered my thoughts and walked towards the field as well. I never had a chance to play this game but I know how this works I guess, based on what I saw on the TV. I just pray to the heavens that I may not break my neck in the process.
                    I wanted to win so badly too but can I pull it off?
                </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg" src="../../3 Images/snitch.gif" />
                <p>
                    The game started after the whistle blow of the referee. I tapped my broom to command it to fly. The game was so intense. Until the tie breaker came, I need to find the snitch to assure my teams victory. Everyone was signaling me to do my job.
                    I collected myself and focus, roaming around the field to spot that ball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I found that golden flying ball thingy that the captain used to describe. I set my eyes on it and chased the ball with all my might then suddenly, a storm of students chases after me as well, wanting the snitch too. We chased around the field,
                    toils and turns until I was finally joined by my teammates as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“DON’T LET THAT SNITCH GET AWAAAY. WE HAVEE TO WIN. WE GOT THIS. Now GO! GO! GO!”</b> My captain shouted. I nodded and I chase after it not letting it out of my sight. When the snitch is almost at my grasp, I heard a loud bang from the back. It was one of my teammates.
                    He was smacked out of his broom and fell. I don't know what to do, should I go save him?'
