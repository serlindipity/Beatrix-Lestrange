                    fter contemplating, I looked back at the snitch that I was chasing with the opposing team, he almost had it in his grasped so I decided to kicked his broom and send him off
                    balance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crowd roared, cheering for me. It was the best feeling in the world. It fueled my urge to win. With one more switch motion, I grab the snitch with all my might, then the whistle blew.
                    I feel like I was floating in the air after that intense battle for the snitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone was cheering for me. I looked around and saw my teammates screaming from the top of their lungs cheering for victory.

                    I was congratulated with my team and awarded as the champion.
                    The captain handed me a golden snitch in a bracelet.
