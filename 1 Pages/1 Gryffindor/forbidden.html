                        opened my eyes in the Forbidden Forest. It was cold and moist. I stood up to find my balance, when I heard a loud cry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>“HEEEEELPPPPP!!! Pleaseeee help me.”</b> I rushed to find the person screaming.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            As soon as I find the old man, a horrifying monster is attacking him. It looks like a lifeless creature that is sucking the life out of him. It terrifies me straight to the bones. This is the same monster I saw in
                            one of my dreams at night.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He signaled me to help him with the little strength he had left. After a few tugs and fight with the monster, his body was lifted up to the air and a shadow is sucked from his mouth as he
                            lifelessly floats.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I panicked. I am so scared. Bloody hell. Is this real? I slapped my face a few times to checked yet nothing happened. I decided to look around hoping to find something that can destroy the monster.
                            Until, I saw an old looking rugged hat from the bushes beside the alley way, this must be from the old man. I saw a shining object inside the hat, this may be able to defeat the monster.
