                <p>
                    fter a few seconds of contemplation, I’ve decided to join Draco and celebrate Goyle’s party with them.
                </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg" src="../../3 Images/bouncer.png" />
                <p>
                    We hurried down to the venue, we saw two big men standing outside, which I think are night club’s bouncers. Draco parked the car in a clear space, then we walked over to the entrance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Password?” </b> said one of the bouncers sternly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Adjezz apro krutum” </b> I answered while smirking. Draco and I often chill in this club so I already know the password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we got in, we were instantly hounded with the sound of our favorite genre of music. There was hip hop, R n B and dance blaring out of the DJ system on stage.
                    We could see hundreds of witches and wizards. Auror graduates of this year were here, Quidditch teams, and other familiar faces.
                </p>

                <img class="pagecontentimg" src="../../3 Images/goyleparty.png" />
                <p>
                    <b>“Draco, Bea! so glad you could make it.” </b> said Goyle, clamping a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Yeah, tho Bea almost backed out telling me that she’ll go study instead” </b> said Draco
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>"What a nice joke, Bea" </b> said Goyle, and the both of them laugh together
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Heeey! I was just worried I’ll be a failure like you two” </b> I rolled my eyes, and said as my defense
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Yeah right, you could worry later, but now let’s go and enjoy the party all night!!!” </b> said Draco, as he excitedly hit the dance floor
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“That’s mah man! I have reserved you two a space in the VIP section. You can have all the drinks you want, it’s on me” </b> said Goyle.
                </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg3" src="../../3 Images/drinks.png" />
                <p>
                    Then we went to the VIP Section, and became the life of the party. A lot of Draco’s friends are there. All of them smiled and greeted us as, and we have fun together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was fun, elegant and exhilarating. I was enjoying myself so much, as if it’s the last night of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Dang! This feels hella good. Just chilling with every witch and wizards of my age.”</b> I thought to myself
                </p>
                <p>
                    And just like Goyle said, we drink all the drinks that we can. I’m so wasted, but this feels good! It’s worth it than studying! …right?
                </p>
