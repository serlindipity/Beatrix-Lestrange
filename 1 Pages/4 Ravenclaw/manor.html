                    open my eyes and saw Draco sitting in the dining hall. He’s my cousin and very close to me, like a brother.

                <p>
                    <b>“Beatrix, c’mon now. I’m almost done with my sandwich. Are you done already?” </b> He shouted and said. I looked at him confusedly
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“What are you talking about? Are we going somewhere or anything? I can’t remember that we have plans for today.” </b>  I asked

                        “Bea, I told you a hundred times, we are going to Boyle’s birthday party celebration today, right? He is one of my minions. He asked me to bring you as well since lately you’ve been so
                        immersed with your books. Anyways, everybody’s coming too. So better get dressed already.”
                    </b> He sighed and replied, then he gulped his drink and stood up.

                    <b>“But Draco we need to study for the upcoming entrance exams in Hogwarts tomorrow, remember? We need to pass the exam for admission.”</b> I said, but he laughed at me saying
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> “Do you really think I care about that? Besides, Boyle said that we can use any quill we like for the exam, which means? We can buy a self-answering quill to answer the exams for you and me. What’s there to lose?”</b>
                    He showed me his smug face, grinning triumphantly. I sighed looking at my cousin.

                    He rarely takes things seriously because uncle Lucius is powerful enough to save him all the time. But on the other hand, he’s right. I can just trash my book and have fun with him. Should I go with him then?
