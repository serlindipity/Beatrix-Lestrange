                    s I start looking around the classroom, I noticed my cousin, Draco looking smug and confident with his new self-answering quill (which we bought). I just hope that it would be enough to get us high grades. I really wanted to be in Ravenclaw before anything else.

                <p>
                    <b>“Students please settle down. We will now begin the exam.” </b> The professor came in and said
                </p>
                <p>
                    I collected myself sat comfortably at my table and wait for the professor to distribute the test questionnaire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Beatrix Lestrange, I supposed this is yours.” </b> He handed me my questionnaire with my name on it. I nodded and proceed to read the questionnaire.
                </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg2" src="../../3 Images/quill.png" />
                <p>
                    <b>
                        “Now, Now, everybody, please surrender your quills to our resident elves for safe keeping purpose because you will be using the schools designated quills in answering the exams. This is to prevent cheating. Now if you have concerns,
                        you are free not to take the exam and leave this room. Thank you.”
                    </b> He said
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this, the resident elves started roaming around to collect the quills.
                </p>                <p>
                    <b>“How am I supposed to pass this exam? I can’t answer this on my own. All these things are unfamiliar to me.”  </b> I panicked. I am fidgeting and scared.
                </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg3" src="../../3 Images/potiondraco.png" />
                <p>The color of my face starts to turn pale as soon as the resident elf is only 2 blocks away from me. I looked at Draco all smug even though his quill was taken. I noticed he drank <b><i>Baruffio's Brain Elixir.</i></b> </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“That sly fox! He has that potion for insurance. Ugh!” </b> I thought to myself. After a while, the resident elf soon confiscated my quill
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started with my exam with history of magic. I am still finding ways on how to answer this
                </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg" src="../../3 Images/test.png" />
                <p>
                    <b>“I can’t believe how hard this exam is. Ugh. I can’t fail.” </b> After a few minutes of contemplating, I remembered an incantation from my mother’s book about having a century-old wisdom but I can’t clearly remember the exact words. I am running out of time; I have to try it as soon as possible
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Engorgio Skullus”</b> I whispered, then after a few minutes, my head starts to torture me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“AHHHH! HELP! MY HEAD! IT HURTS SO MUCH.” </b> I screamed in pain
                </p>
                <p>
                    The professor was quick on his toes to aid me. He ran towards me while swinging his wand saying
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Reductum Skullus.” </b> I fell from my chair and was immediately sent to the hospital wing for treatment. After a few moments with the school nurse, the professor stood on my bedside
                </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg1" src="../../3 Images/beacry.png" />
                <p>
                    <b>
                        “what were you thinking, young lady.”
                    </b> He asked and looked at me disapprovingly
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“If you want to pass the exams, you should’ve have studied harder not try some junky unstable spells.”  </b> I can’t help but sob. I messed up the only chance I have to be admitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“I just want high marks, professor. I wanted to join the house of Ravenclaw so badly. I just-I just-thought I can pull it off. I am sorry.” </b> I replied
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“well, I can’t do anything about it anymore. Your exams were forfeited because of uncertain circumstances like this as instructed by the school’s manual. I admire your courage to admit your wrongdoings but I won’t tolerate disrespect for intellect. I am sorry.” </b>
                    He said & pats my shoulders
                </p>
