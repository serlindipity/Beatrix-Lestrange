                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Alright, Bea. Just so you know, you’re missing so much fun. I’d see you later. Bye!” </b> He walked out the door and left.

                    <b>“This is it. Finally, your hard work will pay off.” </b>I thought to myself.

                    As I start looking around the classroom, I noticed my cousin, Draco looking smug and confident with his new self-answering quill (which I rejected). I just hope that it would be enough to admit him.
                    I noticed that the professor came in
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Students please settle down. We will now begin the exam.” </b> He said.
                </p>
                <p>I collected myself sat comfortably at my table and wait for the professor to distribute the test questionnaire. </p>
                <img class="pagecontentimg" src="../../3 Images/test.png" />
                <p>
                    <b>“Beatrix Lestrange, I supposed this is yours.” </b> He handed me my questionnaire with my name on it. I smiled at him and proceed to read the questionnaire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        “Now, Now, everybody, please surrender your quills to our resident elves for safe keeping purpose because you will be using the schools designated quills in answering the exams. This is to prevent cheating. If you have concerns,
                        you are free not to take the exam and leave this room. Thank you.”
                    </b> He said
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, he asked us to proceed with the exam. My cousin and his minions were all scratching his head thinking how to answer the exam. Well, this should be easy. I studied very hard for this exam since I’ve prepared for this the whole day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Atlas, the exam is over! I was the highest-ranking student in the batch. Well, at least I did fair and square and as for my cousin. Well, he did not pass but that’s okay. Uncle Lucius can be his way in never the less. I was about to leave when the professor called me
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Classed is now dismissed. No one except Lestrange had the accurate copy of the potion I asked you to make. Now leave.” </b>He silently contemplated and announced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        “Come here, child. I want to give you something. As a reward for having the highest score of 93% in the batch. The diadem.”
                    </b> He clings it to my neck and smiled warmly at me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Welcome to Hogwarts. I’ll be keeping an eye on you from now on.” </b> He then left.
