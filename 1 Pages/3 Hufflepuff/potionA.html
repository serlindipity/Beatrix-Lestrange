                    ’ve decided to follow my instincts and add only one mandrake root and heat it for 10 seconds to preserve the herbs and avoid over-cooking it. I proceed with my potion and hope for the best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Beatrix Lestrange, come forth.” </b> I was one of the last students to finish up and called up to be evaluated. The professor called me in front with my pepper-up potion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I nodded and walked down to his table. He scoops a spoon from my potion and he confusedly looked at me
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>“How come your potion taste different from the others? I can distinctly taste the bicorn horn and the mandrake? They’re not overcooked and stand on their own.” </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Yes, professor. I saw that some of the instructions are wrong and may sabotage the herbs and ingredients of the potion. So, I made this potion and followed my instincts.” </b>
                    I confidently replied
                </p>

                    <b>“Classed is now dismissed. No one except Lestrange had the accurate copy of the potion I asked you to make. Now leave.” </b>He silently contemplated and announced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was cleaning up my work space when he approached me
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        “Beatrix Lestrange, you are very talented in potion making. You know by heart how to treat the herbs and the potions whole-heartedly. Marvelous indeed. Here please accept the reward I bestow upon you.
                        The Felix Felicis potion. Congratulations.”
                    </b> He patted my shoulder and left.
