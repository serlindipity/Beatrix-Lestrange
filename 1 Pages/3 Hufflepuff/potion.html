                    opened my eyes and saw fellow students beside me talking and laughing. I look around the room and realized I'm in a potion class. We were given cauldrons, mortar and pestle, a spoon and different herbs. I saw the professor was in.
                    He has long black hair and a very grumpy face. He instructed the class about what potion to do and that whoever makes the most accurate copy of the potion would receive a reward as well as their house. He said that we need a lot of
                    pre-made potion for the winter. Everyone roared and screamed because of the news. All of them were eager to win the reward set by the professor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was looking intently at the ingredients in front of me. It’s a mix of wild berries, sage, sandalwood, cinnamon, mud beak wood, mandrake root, bicorn horn, ash winder egg, squill bulb, horseradish, thyme and purple glittery
                    looking liquid. All of them smelled so wonderful except for the mandrake root, the horn and the egg, however, I have no spells or charm that can bind them all.

                <p>
                    <b>“I don’t even have the slightest idea about what potion we are instructed to make. This is my first time to make a potion I don’t even know if I can make it.” </b>I thought to myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Beatrix Lestrange, what are you doing there? Standing lifelessly in front of your cauldron. Don’t you know how to read? I already put up a set of instructions to make a potion. Move! Don’t just stand there”  </b>
                    As if on cue, the long-haired grumpy professor called me. I nodded in response and gathered the papers in front of me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>“Ugh, this is so embarrassing. I was caught anxiously daydreaming in class.”</b> I sigh and said to myself. I opened the instruction manual that the professor gave us and collected myself. I’ve read the instruction that says:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        “This isn’t right. Adding 2 mandrake root would make it bitter and less appealing. Heating the medium for 50 seconds would over-cook the bicorn horn. It’s easier to cook since it is pre-crushed already. Hmmm. There’s something wrong.”
                    </b> I thought to myself as I contemplate on the manual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“Beatrix Lestrange. For the second time around, I said MOVE! We don’t have all the time to wait for you. All of your classmates are almost done.” </b>Said the professor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“But I-I-Uhm- something- is.”</b> I was interrupted by the professor
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“No buts or ifs or else, get out of my classroom.”</b> He said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>“I’m sorry professor. I’ll get going.” </b>I gulped and answered, but he just rolled his eyes at me and instructed me to start. What should I do?
