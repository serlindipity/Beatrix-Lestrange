                        he sorting hat ceremony is about to begin wherein the new students are sorted to different houses before the welcoming ceremony to get
                        acquainted to their houses. The line of new students was instructed on how the ceremony would proceed. Beatrix was so immersed with her thought when the Sorting Hat started singing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>"Beatrix Lestrange."</b> Professor finally called, making Beatrix jump in surprise. She walked to the room, sitting on the chair comfortably facing a mirror. Professor put the hat on her and smiled reassuringly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>"Ah! What a strange, it's a Lestrange!"</b> The hat shouted, making the little girl jump again, startled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>"Hmm..." </b>It hummed, deeply thinking as it browsed into Beatrix's mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>"A brave girl, indeed, but also cunning and very sly. Loyal to her friends and family, well, not that kind but still... and not that bad of a brain."</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>
                            "Should I put you to Slytherin, where most of the Lestrange are put... or should I make a change and put you to Gryffindor, where your brave heart shall reign? Or perhaps in Hufflepuff where you'll stay just
                            and loyal? Or maybe Ravenclaw where you'll be able to practice and maintain your wit and learning? Well, let's see... It should be..."
                        </b> The sorting hat confusedly ask itself
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>"What!? You're just tossing me anywhere? This is no fair! Don't I have any say about this?" </b> Beatrix frowned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>"Oh, Alright then!!! It should be your decision to make!"</b> The sorting hat exclaimed. The professor was shocked hearing it from the hat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>"Strange isn't it? The first of her kind. A Lestrange will be able to decide, which house does she belongs inside? Confident Child, pick one amongst all, the house that speaks through your soul."</b>
                        after the Sorting Hat spoke these phrases it instructed Beatrix what she needs to do next.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>
                            "Open thy eyes and ye shall not blink, to empty your mind and think, discover what needs to be discovered, but be careful for it might make you overpowered.
                            Decide & make a choice, let the house speak and hear thy voice"
